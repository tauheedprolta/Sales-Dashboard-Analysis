# Sales Dashboard Analysis using Tableau, Excel, and Power BI

## Overview
This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow, starting from raw sales data to visual dashboards built using Tableau, Excel, and Power BI.

The goal of the project is to extract business insights from raw sales data by:
- Cleaning and transforming the data using Python (Jupyter Notebook).
- Designing interactive dashboards using industry-standard tools.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Raw data obtained from Kaggle.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed using Python (see `Clean.ipynb`).
   - Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized date/time formats.

2. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - **Tableau**: Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize key sales metrics.

- Excel
- Tableau
- Power BI

## Files Included
- `Clean.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook used for data preprocessing.
- `Cleaned_Data.xlsx`: Final cleaned dataset used in all dashboards.
- `PowerBI Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard file.
- `Sale Analysis.twbx`: Tableau workbook file.
- `Dashboard.xlsx`: Excel dashboard.
